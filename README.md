We have all kinds of tools that check for errors in code (compiler,
linter, vetter, model checker, etc.), but only clumsy humans ever
check the commentsâ€”more than half of them don't care if what they're
reading is correct. Enter gospel: it checks spelling (and possibly
grammar, if we get super ambitious) in your Go doc comments. It is
aware of identifiers, so it won't flag things like "fmt" as errors.
